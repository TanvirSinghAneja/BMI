THE INPUT FUNCTIONA LLOW THE USER TO ENTER THE DATA. THIS HAS BEEN APPLIED TO THE NAME, WEIGHT AND HEIGHT VARIABLES. AND SINCE WEIGHT AND HEIGHT ARE NUMERIC VALUES WHICH MAY BE DECIMAL WE ADDED A FLOAT FUNCTION AS WELL IN FRONT OF THEM.
THEN USING THESE VARIABLES WE PLACED THEM IN THE FORMULA OF BMI AND STORED THE RESULT IN A VARIABLE 'BMI'. THEN WE PRINT THE BMI AND ROUNDING OF THE VALUE TO 2 DECIMAL PLACES.
THEN USING THE IF CONDITION AND WHEN BMI IS MORE THAN ZERO WE THEN DECIDE WHICH CATEGORY DOES THE BMI FALL IN AND ON BASIS OF THAT WE PRINT THE CRITERIA. ALONG WITH THAT IF THE DATA FALLS BELOW ZERO WE WILL PRINT TO ENTER VALID DATA, AS BMI CAN NOT BE LESSE THAN ZERO.
